                <p class="des">Located on Puran Das Road it has a delightfully traditional setting. There is a chula
                    (stove) at the entrance along with a sil batta (grinding stone) and a few other traditional cooking
                    implements set in a rural ambience. Inside, there are charpoys on which you can sit cross-legged and
                    eat, and take home an authentic experience. You can even opt for a modern table setting.

                    The food is served in huge brass plates and katoris. The most popular dishes here are the
                    traditional ones from eastern UP and Bihar – litti chokha and sattu parathas. Littis are hard,
                    oven-baked channa dal cakes eaten with piping hot dal and chokha (traditionally made smoked
                    eggplant) with an array of pickles. Batti Choka is also famous for its thali, in which you get a
                    sampling of all their dishes for just 150 per head. It’s worth every paisa and go there on an empty
                    stomach, you won’t regret it.</p>

                            <p class="des">Varanasi is famous for its own style of chaat: dahi bhalla, tamatar ki chaat
                                and palak chaat. There are two outlets of Deena’s but the one near Dashashwamedha Ghat
                                is more popular. The tamatar chaat is finely cut tomatoes mashed up with spices, while
                                the palak chaat has crispy batter fried spinach leaves served with dahi, sev, sweetened
                                tamarind chutney and spicy green chutney. The dahi bhalla is a sweeter version of what
                                you get on Delhi’s streets – it has a generous sprinkling of raisins that lends it a
                                sweetened taste.</p>

                                        <p class="des">This one does not serve traditional Indian food, but has
                                            sandwiches, omelets, breads and other such offerings popular with
                                            foreigners. There are three or four shops with the same name around
                                            Dashashwamedha Ghat. But this one is located on the fourth floor of a narrow
                                            building. The eating area is covered with a grill cage to keep out the
                                            monkeys that prance about on rooftops.
                                            The food is expensive and the taste is average but it’s recommended for its
                                            ambience. Also, after a few days of eating vegetarian food in Banaras, this
                                            is perhaps one of the few places around the ghats where you can get
                                            non-vegetarian food.</p>

                                            paan. There are shops all over the city, but Deepak’s near Dashashwamedh
                                            Ghat is most popular. Paan is made from beetle nut leaves with beetle nuts,
                                            lime, and a selection of condiments, and generally eaten with a lot with
                                            tobacco or lime. A word of caution to those trying this for the first time –
                                            both these ingredients can make your head spin, and one should definitely
                                            not ignore the statutory warning that comes with any form of tobacco.

                                            The other option is the meetha paan, a version made with tobacco or lime but
                                            filled with sweetened rose petals (gulkand), fennel seeds (saunf), and soft
                                            and chewy supari (beetle nut).</p>

                                            Kachori Gali. The smell the kachoris being fried catches up with you as you
                                            walk into this lane. Small nooks in the wall serve these freshly fried
                                            kachoris (stuffed with dal or peas) and served with spicy mint chutney. The
                                            shops open as early as 7am and remain open till 7pm, but depending on the
                                            season, they may run out of kachoris early especially when pilgrims are in
                                            town.

                                                Uttar Pradesh dating to the 11th
                                                century B.C. Regarded as the spiritual capital of India, the city draws
                                                Hindu pilgrims who bathe in the
